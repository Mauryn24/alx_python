API (Application Programming Interface):
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, enabling them to work together and perform various tasks. APIs are used for various purposes, such as accessing web services, databases, or hardware devices.

REST API (Representational State Transfer API):
A REST API is a type of API that follows the principles of REST, which is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources represented by URLs. They typically use JSON or XML as data formats and are known for their simplicity and scalability.

Microservices:
Microservices is an architectural style where a large application is divided into smaller, loosely coupled services that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each microservice focuses on a specific function or business capability and communicates with other services via APIs. This approach allows for greater agility, easier maintenance, and scalability in complex applications.

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) Format:
CSV is a plain text file format used to store tabular data, such as spreadsheets or databases. In a CSV file, data values are separated by commas (or other delimiters like tabs or semicolons), and each line represents a record or row. It is a common format for exchanging data between different software applications, and Python provides libraries like csv for reading and writing CSV files.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Format:
JSON is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is often used for data exchange between web services and is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language. JSON uses key-value pairs and supports complex data structures like arrays and nested objects.

Pythonic Naming Conventions:

Package and Module Name Style: Use lowercase letters and underscores (snake_case). For example, my_module, my_package.
Class Name Style: Use CapWords or CamelCase, where each word within the name starts with an uppercase letter, and there are no underscores. For example, MyClass, MyAnotherClass.
Variable Name Style: Use lowercase letters and underscores (snake_case). For example, my_variable, another_variable.
Function Name Style: Use lowercase letters and underscores (snake_case). For example, my_function, calculate_average.
Constant Name Style: Use uppercase letters and underscores (SNAKE_CASE) to represent constants. For example, MAX_VALUE, PI.
Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python:
The use of CapWords or CamelCase for class names is a widely followed convention in Python. It helps distinguish class names from variables and functions, making your code more readable and following a common naming convention in the Python community. This convention is not enforced by the Python interpreter but is considered good practice for writing clean and maintainable code.
