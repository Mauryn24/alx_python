PROJECT TITLE 


Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary


DESCRIPTION 
#Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable. Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

#Dictionaries - Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values

INSTALLATION 


To install the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository git clone https://PAT@github.com/username/alx_python.git

Navigate to the alx_python directory

 cd alx_python

create a directory 
python-more_data_structures


Use mkdir python-more_data_structures

Navigate to the directory 


cd python-more_data_structures

USAGE 

Sets and dictionaries are ideal data structures to be used when your data has no intrinsic order, but does have a unique object that can be used to reference it (the reference object is normally a string, but can be any hashable type).
