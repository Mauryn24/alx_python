*Python - Object-relational mapping*


In database programming, the typical pattern is to create a cursor, use it to execute SQL statements (queries, updates, etc.), and then fetch data from the executed queries using the cursor. This pattern is consistent across different files and scripts.


Here's a breakdown of the steps:


Create a Connection: First, you establish a connection to the database using a library like MySQLdb or an ORM like SQLAlchemy. The connection provides a channel through which you can communicate with the database.


Create a Cursor: Once you have a connection, you create a cursor using the connection's cursor() method. The cursor is like a work area where you can execute SQL statements and manage the results.


Execute SQL Statements: You use the cursor's execute() method to execute SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc. The cursor sends the statement to the database server for processing.


Fetch Data: If you executed a SELECT query, you use the cursor's fetch methods (such as fetchall(), fetchone(), fetchmany()) to retrieve the data returned by the query.


Process Data: Once you have fetched the data, you can process it using Python code as needed. This could involve iterating through the rows and columns of the result set, performing calculations, or transforming the data.


Close Cursor and Connection: After you've finished working with the cursor and fetching the data, you close both the cursor and the connection using the close() methods. This releases any resources held by the cursor and closes the connection to the database.


This pattern of creating a connection, creating a cursor, executing SQL statements, fetching data, and closing the cursor and connection is repeated across different files and scripts in your application.


Keep in mind that when using an ORM like SQLAlchemy, much of this low-level cursor management is abstracted away. With an ORM, you work with Python objects that represent database tables, and the ORM handles database interactions for you.

Example;


import MySQLdb

# Establish a connection
db = MySQLdb.connect(host="localhost", user="username", passwd="password", db="database_name")

Where, the database_name is the database to be accessed

# Create a cursor
cursor = db.cursor()

# Execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM table_name")

# Fetch data
results = cursor.fetchall()

# Process and use the fetched data
for row in results:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and the connection
cursor.close()
db.close()
