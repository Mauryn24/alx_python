#TITLE
*Python - hello world*
#DESCRIPTION
The project aims at learning python basics which include:
- The zen of python
- python syntax
- python comments
- python variables
- python booleans
- python operators
- python if...else
- python while loops

#instaliation instructions
To install the project, the following steps are followed:
- create the alx-python repository in github
- clone the repository
git clone https://(pat)9@github.com/(username)/alx_python.git
- navigate to the project repository
cd alx_python
- navigate to the project directory
cd python-hello_world
- create the necessary files in the directory

4. Usage
- python syntax
to execute python syntax: create a file with the py extension. That is, file.py. 
To print use print(). for example, print("hello"

Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

Booleans represent one of two values: True or False.
one can use the bool()function
- python operators
some of the operators include +, -, *, /, or, and, xor
- python if...else
can be used in conjuction with loops to specify a block of code that should be executed only when a loop has completed all iterations without encountering a 'break' statement
- python while loops
used in iterations
- rand
used to give a random output but one must import the random module before using

5. Features
- printing text using print
if, if...else
- loops
- range
return
