*Web framework*


Web framework is a software that is designed to support the development of web applications

*type of web frameworks*

1. Server-side - the one to work on the server side, that helps to set up the app logic on the server. ie, backend
The rules and architecture of the server-side frameworks permit you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different kinds. To create a web application with a well-developed interface you need a wider range of functionality. Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc. These frameworks can improve security and form the output data- simplifying the development process. Some of the top server-side frameworks are –

NET (C#)
Django (Python)
Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
Express (JavaScript/Node.JS)
Symfony (PHP)


2. User-side - to work on the client side. ie, front end

Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces. A number of animated features can be created with frontend and single page applications. Every client-side framework varies in functionality and use. Here are some client-side frameworks for comparison’s sake; all of whom use JavaScript as their programming language-

Angular
Ember.JS
Vue.JS
React.JS


*Web application framework- Architecture*


Most of the web frameworks depend on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The reason why this pattern is preferred lies in its rational design that separates the app logic from the interface and forms the three essential parts that are represented in the architecture’s name — MVC (Model-View-Controller).
